‚ú® In the spirit of open source, I have gathered some good resources for developers and as myself a data scientist some of good and excellent article written on the internet. Most of them are experience people who are sharing their journey in tech field where we could learn something. 

 üç¥ You can fork and PR if you want to add the resource and I will immediately merge (if its relatable) to the main!
